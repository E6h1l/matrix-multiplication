# Divide-and-Conquer Matrix Multiplication

This repository contains a Python implementation of matrix multiplication using a recursive divide-and-conquer algorithm. It compares the performance of this approach against NumPy's built-in matrix multiplication.

## Usage

```bash
# Ensure you have Python and NumPy installed
# pip install numpy

# Run the matrix multiplication script
python matrix_multiplication.py
```
*(You can modify the matrix size `n` and threshold `L` directly in the `matrix_multiplication.py` file)*
